# Olist-Le-Wagon-Challenge

Project done as part of a middle-course challenge for Le Wagon Bootcamp.

The Jupyter Notebook contain a step-by-step of the approach I took to analyse the dataset and provide feedback.
We already had previously created several Classes and functions to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
